					<p>Play the default version of the game, invented by Mr. Turner from Turner's Tutorials!</p>
					<p>
						The computer will generate a number from 1-100, and you have to guess what that number is.
						You can add or subtract 1, 5, 10, or 25 to guess a number, and depending on how close your guess is, the computer will mark it hot or cold.
						You have 5 guesses, but very hot doesn't remove a guess. Good luck!

				<div>
					<h1>Play Custom</h1>
					<p>Change up hot and cold to your hearts content!</p>
					<p>
						Use your creativity (something software majors don't have) and modify hot and cold how you please!
						Set the guesses, range, and addition blocks to make the game harder or easier, depending on how you feel.
						Have fun and get creating!

					<h1>Play Extreme</h1>
					<p>Make the game extra spicy if you're in search of a challenge</p>
					<p>
						The computer will guess a number like usual, but this time it doesn't tell you if you're hot or cold.
						You still only have five guesses, so guess away, and try to get lucky.
